# Command line flags

A more in-depth discussion of various `gh-ost` command line flags: implementation, implication, use cases.

### allow-on-master

By default, `gh-ost` would like you to connect to a replica, from where it figures out the master by itself. This wiring is required should your master execute using `binlog_format=STATEMENT`.

If, for some reason, you do not wish `gh-ost` to connect to a replica, you may connect it directly to the master and approve this via `--allow-on-master`.

### approve-renamed-columns

When your migration issues a column rename (`change column old_name new_name ...`) `gh-ost` analyzes the statement to try an associate the old column name with new column name. Otherwise the new structure may also look like some column was dropped and another was added.

`gh-ost` will print out what it thinks the _rename_ implied, but will not issue the migration unless you provide with `--approve-renamed-columns`.

If you think `gh-ost` is mistaken and that there's actually no _rename_ involved, you may pass `--skip-renamed-columns` instead. This will cause `gh-ost` to disassociate the column values; data will not be copied between those columns.

### assume-rbr

If you happen to _know_ your servers use RBR (Row Based Replication, i.e. `binlog_format=ROW`), you may specify `--assume-rbr`. This skips a verification step where `gh-ost` would issue a `STOP SLAVE; START SLAVE`.
Skipping this step means `gh-ost` would not need the `SUPER` privilege in order to operate.
You may want to use this on Amazon RDS

### conf

`--conf=/path/to/my.cnf`: file where credentials are specified. Should be in (or contain) the following format:

  ```
[client]
user=gromit
password=123456
  ```

### cut-over

Optional. Default is `safe`. See more discussion in [cut-over](cut-over.md)

### exact-rowcount

A `gh-ost` execution need to copy whatever rows you have in your existing table onto the ghost table. This can, and often be, a large number. Exactly what that number is?
`gh-ost` initially estimates the number of rows in your table by issuing an `explain select * from your_table`. This will use statistics on your table and return with a rough estimate. How rough? It might go as low as half or as high as double the actual number of rows in your table. This is the same method as used in [`pt-online-schema-change`](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.2/pt-online-schema-change.html).

`gh-ost` also supports the `--exact-rowcount` flag. When this flag is given, two things happen:
- An initial, authoritative `select count(*) from your_table`.
  This query may take a long time to complete, but is performed before we begin the massive operations.
- A continuous update to the estimate as we make progress applying events.
  We heuristically update the number of rows based on the queries we process from the binlogs.

While the ongoing estimated number of rows is still heuristic, it's almost exact, such that the reported  [ETA](understanding-output.md) or percentage progress is typically accurate to the second throughout a multiple-hour operation.

### execute

Without this parameter, migration is a _noop_: testing table creation and validity of migration, but not touching data.

### initially-drop-ghost-table

`gh-ost` maintains two tables while migrating: the _ghost_ table (which is synced from your original table and finally replaces it) and a changelog table, which is used internally for bookkeeping. By default, it panics and aborts if it sees those tables upon startup. Provide `--initially-drop-ghost-table` and `--initially-drop-old-table` to let `gh-ost` know it's OK to drop them beforehand.

We think `gh-ost` should not take chances or make assumptions about the user's tables. Dropping tables can be a dangerous, locking operation. We let the user explicitly approve such operations.

### initially-drop-old-table

See #initially-drop-ghost-table

### migrate-on-replica

Typically `gh-ost` is used to migrate tables on a master. If you wish to only perform the migration in full on a replica, connect `gh-ost` to said replica and pass `--migrate-on-replica`. `gh-ost` will briefly connect to the master but other issue no changes on the master. Migration will be fully executed on the replica, while making sure to maintain a small replication lag.

### skip-renamed-columns

See `approve-renamed-columns`

### test-on-replica

Issue the migration on a replica; do not modify data on master. Useful for validating, testing and benchmarking. See [test-on-replica](test-on-replica.md)
